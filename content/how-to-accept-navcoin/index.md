## For your store - NavPay

NavPay is a light wallet that you can use to accept digital payments in NavCoin on your mobile or desktop. Payments show up almost instantly and your balance is protected because your private keys are stored on your device, not the internet. This demo shows how quick and easy it is to use NavPay.

## For your online business - Coinpayments

Coinpayments is a little like PayPal, but instead of conventional credit cards it’s a payment gateway for digital currency payments. 

Coinpayments features merchant tools that make it easy to integrate NavCoin payments with your current website and at point-of-sale. Plug-ins include a shopping cart, payment button, invoicing, and point-of-sale interface. If your business is based in the US or the Euro Zone you can have your NavCoin payments deposited to your bank account in fiat currency.

For more information, or to get started with Coinpayments right away visit their website.

## For your blog - Nav Buttons

Integrating Nav Buttons for quick payments is an easy to implement option that suits individuals (for example selling your art direct to the public). 

It’s as easy as copy pasting some code onto your website. There is a choice of embeddable or React component buttons, and QR codes for even easier sharing.

Find out more and get the code to add to your site here.

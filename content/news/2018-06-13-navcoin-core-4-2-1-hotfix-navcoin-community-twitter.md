Last week the Core Developers discovered and fixed an issue that prevented NavPi’s updating 4.2.0 and signal their support for the community fund accumulation soft fork. It was good to see Core Developers rallying to fulfill the objectives laid out in the Developer Manifesto - ensuring the stability of the network takes priority over all other tasks. So thanks to everyone who helped out - and burned the midnight oil for the greater good of the NavCoin network.

### What’s happening in the community

CoinPayments helps everyone in the NavCoin community by making it easy to pay using NAV. This week they’ve gone a step further with this Tweet promoting NavCoin to their followers. Thanks guys.

To support Coin Payments, start by checking out their directory of stores accepting NAV, then get out your NavCoin wallet and buy something.

\### Technical updates

Last week NavCoin Core 4.2.0 was released which includes the Community Fund accumulation soft fork. Uptake by the network was slowed due to an issue in the NTP sync calculation on 32 bit systems which included the NavPi. The issue has now been resolved and the NavCoin Core 4.2.1 NTP Hotfix is ready to download. The full list of new binaries to download are available on Github here.

If you agree with the consensus change and want to signal your support for the community fund accumulation soft fork, make sure you download this new version of NavCoin Core and resume staking blocks.

Congratulations to Sakdeniz (on Discord) for releasing the 1.0.2 alpha version of his NEXT wallet  for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu. It looks fantastic. Check out the release notes here:

hash512 (on Discord) has been working with Sakdeniz to get NEXT running on his NavCoin m8. It should be ready to go on sale in early July, after a little more burn in testing. 

NavCoin m8 will be deployed with the NavCoin software, the NEXT wallet, and a bitcoin wallet installed. Any other Proof of Stake coin wallets that have been tested will also go out at launch, or be added at a later date. 

For more info on this awesome community project check out the m8 channel on Discord and visit the NavCoin m8 website

\### Content updates

Social media was a big focus last week, with the creation of a series of posts on the NavCoin Core 4.2.0 release, the 4.2.1 hotfix, CoinPayments, and the Developer and Content Manifestos. There is now a large pool of social posts buffered and ready to go, meaning NavCoin will have a continuous presence on the key social channels.

The Core Content Collective continued their work on updating content in the refreshed navcoin.org developer site and navhub.org community site. You can see more detail on how the Community Fund will operate here. (waiting on PR to go live)

<https://navhub.org/projects/community-fund>

To introduce the concept of the Fund and invite community members to signal their agreement to the NavCoin Core 4.2.0 soft fork, a short animated video was created. Look out for it soon in our social channels and on navhub.org. 

And if developing the awesome NEXT wallet wasn’t enough Sakdeniz has been experimenting with another batch of NAV logo animations called ‘Dust’ and ‘Bling’, which you can check out here:

That’s all for this week,

NavCoin Core

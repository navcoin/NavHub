In other news this week, Encrypt S have updated their projects on the NavCoin Community Roadmap to include the Kauri Wallet project, Craig embarks on a tough charity challenge, and community members have posted handy tips on choosing the right NavCoin wallet and updating to NavCoin Core 4.2.1.

### What’s happening in the community

It’s always interesting hearing how people got into crypto. With that in mind, xVicious started this fascinating thread on Reddit - asking community members to share how they first became aware of NavCoin. What’s your NavCoin story? Join the conversation here.

In this latest post at navcoinitalia.com Nio (on Discord) talks (in Italian) about SEC regulations and what they could mean for decentralised cryptocurrencies. Watch it here.

It looks like Rowan definitely earned that beer - here’s another perspective from his visit to Iceland on his way to Berlin.

By now NavCoin Core Developer Craig (prole on Discord) is a few days into his Oxfam Refugee Ration Challenge. Over the course of the week, he will discover what it’s like to survive on the strictly limited amount of very basic rations Syrian refugees are issued, Craig’s aim is to raise $10,000 NZD for the cause. You can show your support by following his journey on his Instagram and Twitter.

### Technical updates



There are a few updates to the projects Encrypt S works on in the roadmap on the NavCoin community site. The main changes involve the addition of the Kauri Wallet, including the extended features that are being built on top of it. You can see the changes here:



<https://navhub.org/roadmap/>



And the full details about the new Kauri Wallet here:



<https://navhub.org/projects/kauri> 



The Kauri wallet is a new open-source multi-currency wallet that is being developed by Encrypt S. NavCoin will be the first coin to get access to the wallet’s advanced features. 



You can read more about how the Kauri wallet came about in this post by Craig:

The latest work by developers on Kauri has included:



- Added automatic testing of the app size so it doesn't grow too large, unnoticed.

- Added performance benchmarking.

- Merging translations into the build and deployment processes, so Kauri can work across all platforms in multiple languages.

- Investigation and testing of different library options for the core Kauri Wallet blockchain code, including bcoin, bitcoin-js and bitcore-core libraries.

- Research and discussions about the wallet UX.

- Research how to create a decentralized exchange that works seamlessly with Kauri and other platforms.

- Development of a feature for Kauri API that allows it to be run with zero-configuration. Developers will be able to run the binary on their machines and the Kauri API will automatically download, extract, configure, and start the navcoind daemon utilising a custom data directory, so that the default nav configuration directory is left intact. This will allow for a smooth development workflow as devs connect front-end Kauri wallet UI elements to the API while working via localhost.

- Set up a pipeline for translating the app.

- Setting the base translation solution to enable automated updating of translation files when text is changed in the app. 

- Creation of a tool to check how many lines in app are untranslated for each of the supported languages.



Look out for more updates and information as work on this project proceeds over the coming months.

Last week this animated video introducing NavCoin 4.2.1 was created and launched on social media. The aim was to:

- Generate awareness of the update to the NavCoin Core protocol.

- Let NavCoin stakers know where to download the new wallet if they agree to the consensus change.

- Show how accumulation of NAV in the Community Fund will work.

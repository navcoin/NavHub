    <p>NavTech is an application which operates in parallel to the NavCoin protocol to provide optional private payments of NAV.</p>
    <p>NavTech uses a dual blockchain system for sending private NavCoin payments. Essentially, the transaction information is encrypted and sent in & out of a second blockchain, which helps break the link between the sender and receiver.</p>
    <p>The code is open source and decentralized – meaning anyone can setup their own NavTech servers or use other community operated ones.</p>

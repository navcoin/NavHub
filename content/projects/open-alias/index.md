    <p>OpenAlias is an open standard that allows users to transform a lengthy wallet address into a form that’s more like an email address - making it easier to read, write, and remember. </p>
    <p>For example, NavCoin payments can be sent to <b>john@nav.community</b> instead of <b>n1VjTCJBWDEVnasduUBb1ry83yLYihh8XnP</b>.</p>

### Overview

NAV OpenAlias is a little like PayPal, which lets you send a payment to an email address. The difference is that OpenAlias uses an easy to remember 'email style' address to represent your full NavCoin wallet address.

For more information, visit [openalias.org](https://openalias.org/)
<br /><br />


### Registering for an NAV OpenAlias address

If you wish to create your alias visit [http://openalias.nav.community](http://openalias.nav.community). This site is currently in beta, and can only be implemented using the NavCoin Core wallet. The next stage will involve adding this functionality to other NavCoin wallets (such as NavPay), as well as an entire overhaul of the registration process.
<br /><br />


### Who created OpenAlias?

OpenAlias was created by contributors to the [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) cryptocurrency project who wanted to find a way of simplifying cryptocurrency payments by bridging the knowledge gap between cryptographically secure systems and users who aren't sophisticated developers.
